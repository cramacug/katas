Practice with Katas from https://codingdojo.org/kata/eight-queens/

This kata is based on the classic chess rules. You must put eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard such that none of them is able to
capture any other using the standard chess queen’s moves.

Tips: you could have only one queen by row and column.
